Since that time, it has been \ndetermined that: \n academic sanctions for infractions of academic integrity have been \nimposed in inconsistent ways across campus; \n student misconduct often goes unreported, resulting in a lack of university \nknowledge, input, and oversight and an inability of the university to \nrecognize patterns of conduct; \n no formal grade appeal process currently exists for accused students who \nare found not responsible in the student conduct process or whose cases \nare dismissed. \nPartly for these reasons, the University has not been in complete compliance with CSU \nexecutive orders on academic integrity (E.O. 1037, 1068, and 1098). This policy addresses the \nproblems. \nApproved and signed by \nInterim President Susan W. Martin on \nNovember 5, 2015. \nUniversity Policy: \nAcademic Integrity \nResolved: That the attached be implemented as policy, rescinding S07-2. \nRationale: There is a need for faculty members to report all instances of academic \nmisconduct and provide a complete record of accused students’ academic \nperformance; equal treatment demands it. The University can gain awareness of \npatterns of infraction only if it has a record of student infractions. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudent rights must also be upheld. Currently, student conduct violations and \nfaculty academic sanctions are reviewed by the Office of Student Conduct and \nEthical Development (SCED). When SCED reaches a finding in favor of the \nstudent – either the finding of not responsible or a lack of evidence of the \nviolation – the faculty member may appeal the decision to the Board of Academic \nFreedom and Professional Responsibility (BAFPR). \nHowever, a student has no comparable avenue of appeal when the faculty \nmember refuses to lift a sanction after a SCED finding in the student’s favor.

Academic honesty and fairness foster ethical standards for all \nthose who rely on the integrity of the university, its courses, and its degrees. University \ndegrees are compromised and the public is defrauded if faculty members or students \nknowingly or unwittingly allow dishonest acts to be rewarded academically. \nThis policy sets the standards for such integrity and shall be used to inform students, faculty, \nand staff of the university’s Academic Integrity Policy. \nSTUDENT ROLE \nThe San José State University Academic Integrity Policy requires that each student: \n1. know the rules that preserve academic integrity and abide by them at all times, including \nlearning and abiding by rules associated with specific classes, exams, and course \nassignments; \n2. know the consequences of violating the Academic Integrity Policy; \n3. know the appeal rights and procedures to be followed in the event of an appeal; \n4. foster academic integrity among peers. \nFACULTY ROLE \nThe San José State University Academic Integrity Policy requires that each faculty member: \n1. provide a clear and concise course syllabus that apprises students of the Academic \nIntegrity Policy and the ethical standards and supporting procedures required in a course; \n2. make every"}, {"source": "pdfs/SJSU-Academic-Integrity-Policy-F15-7.pdf", "chunk": "University Academic Integrity Policy requires that each faculty member: \n1. provide a clear and concise course syllabus that apprises students of the Academic \nIntegrity Policy and the ethical standards and supporting procedures required in a course; \n2. make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct.

Cheating includes: \n1.1.1 copying, in part or as a whole, from another’s test or other evaluation \ninstrument, including homework assignments, worksheets, lab reports, \nessays, summaries, and quizzes; \n1.1.2 submitting work previously graded in another course without prior approval \nby the course instructor or by departmental policy; \n1 Currently available at \nhttp://www.sjsu.edu/studentconduct/docs/Student%20Conduct%20Code%202013.pdf. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1."}, {"source": "pdfs/SJSU-Academic-Integrity-Policy-F15-7.pdf", "chunk": "or by departmental policy; \n1 Currently available at \nhttp://www.sjsu.edu/studentconduct/docs/Student%20Conduct%20Code%202013.pdf. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.1.3 submitting work simultaneously presented in two or more courses without \nprior approval of all course instructors or by the departmental policies of all \ndepartments; \n1.1.4 using or consulting sources, tools, or materials prohibited by the instructor \nprior to or during an examination; \n1.1.5 altering or interfering with the grading process; \n1.1.6 sitting for an examination by a surrogate or as a surrogate; \n1.1.7 any other act committed by a student in the course of his or her academic \nwork that defrauds or misrepresents, including aiding others in any of the \nactions defined above. \n1.2 PLAGIARISM \nSan José State University defines plagiarism as the act of representing the work of \nanother as one’s own without giving appropriate credit, regardless of how that work was \nobtained, and submitting it to fulfill academic requirements. \nPlagiarism includes: \n1.2.1 knowingly or unknowingly incorporating the ideas, words, sentences, \nparagraphs, parts of sentences or paragraphs, or the specific substance of \nanother’s work without giving appropriate credit, and representing the \nproduct as one’s own work; \n1.2.2 representing anot her’s artistic or scholarly works, such as computer \nprograms, instrument printouts, inventions, musical compositions, \nphotographs, paintings, drawings, sculptures, novels, short stories, \npoems, screen plays, or television scripts, as one’s own. \n2.0 NOTIFICATION OF STANDARDS OF DETECTING PLAGIARISM \nSan José State University or its faculty may subscribe to or use plagiarism-detection services. \nAny plagiarism-detection service used by faculty or with which San José State University \ncontracts shall ensure compliance with FERPA, university data security policies, and \naccessibility requirements. \nExcept for the stated purpose of storing submitted work in databases solely for the purpose of \ndetecting plagiarism, any plagiarism-detection service with which San José State University \ncontracts shall, to the fullest extent possible, agree to assure that ownership rights of all \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubmitted work shall"}, {"source": "pdfs/SJSU-Academic-Integrity-Policy-F15-7.pdf", "chunk": "of \ndetecting plagiarism, any plagiarism-detection service with which San José State University \ncontracts shall, to the fullest extent possible, agree to assure that ownership rights of all \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubmitted work shall remain with the work’s author and not with the plagiarism-detection \nservice. \n3.0 SANCTIONS \nThere shall be two major classifications of sanctions that may be imposed for violations of this \npolicy: academic and administrative. Academic sanctions are actions related to coursework or \ngrades and are determined by the faculty member. Administrative sanctions are actions that \naddress a student’s status on campus and are determined by SCED. Academic sanctions and \nadministrative sanctions may be imposed simultaneously. \n3.1 ACADEMIC SANCTIONS \nFaculty members are responsible for determining academic sanctions. Faculty \nmembers may find it helpful to consult with their department chair or school director, \nsenior faculty members, or the director of SCED in consideration of appropriate \nacademic sanctions. Such sanctions shall be proportional to the offense. The academic \nsanction is usually a form of “grade modification.” Before sanctions can be employed, \nthe faculty member must have verified the instance(s) of academic dishonesty by \npersonal observation or documentation. The faculty member is expected to maintain in \nconfidence notes and communications between the student and the faculty member as \nthey may be relevant in subsequent disciplinary proceedings or any subsequent legal \nactions. \nRecommended academic sanctions include: \n3.1.1 oral reprimand; \n3.1.2 repetition of the assignment with sufficient change in instructions such that \nnone of the original assignment can be utilized; \n3.1.3 lower grade on the evaluation instrument; \n3.1.4 failure on the evaluation instrument; \n3.1.5 reduction in course grade; \n3.1.6 failure in the course; \n3.1.7 recommendation of additional administrative sanctions (SCED to review \nfor possible violations of the Student Conduct Code). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFaculty Discretion \nIncidents involving the careless or inept handling of quoted material that fall short \nof the definitions of cheating or plagiarism, as defined in Items 1.1 and 1.2 of this \npolicy, may be dealt with at the discretion of the faculty member concerned. \nThe faculty member also has the discretion and obligation to determine whether \nspecific acts by a student fall under the description"}, {"source": "pdfs/SJSU-Academic-Integrity-Policy-F15-7.pdf", "chunk": "1.1 and 1.2 of this \npolicy, may be dealt with at the discretion of the faculty member concerned. \nThe faculty member also has the discretion and obligation to determine whether \nspecific acts by a student fall under the description in 1.1.7. \n3.2 ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS \nAs stipulated in Executive Order 1098 (Student Conduct Procedures), violations of the \nStudent Conduct Code (Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations Section 41301), \nincluding cheating or plagiarism in connection with an academic program, may warrant \nexpulsion, suspension, probation, or a lesser sanction. Administrative action involving \nacademic dishonesty shall be the responsibility of SCED. SCED shall respond to \nreferrals from the faculty of violations of the Academic Integrity Policy. It shall further \nrespond to repeat violations as brought to its attention by the centralized reports filed \nwith SCED. \nSCED shall notify faculty members when action has been taken. It shall maintain a \nrecord of students who have been reported for violating the Academic Integrity Policy. \n4.0 EVALUATION AND REPORTING \nWhen a faculty member suspects a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy and is in \npossession of evidence to substantiate that violation (not excluding a statement of personal \nobservation of the infraction by the faculty member or other SJSU personnel or students in the \nclass), it is the faculty member’s responsibility to take the following steps: \n4.1 Confront the situation discretely; that is, faculty members shall not discuss \nspecific charges of cheating, plagiarism, or any other violations involving specific \nindividuals in the classroom or elsewhere before other members of the class. \n4.2 Communicate with the student concerning the alleged violation and arrange for a \nconference to present documentation. In this conference, the student should be \nadvised of the allegation and be made aware of the supporting evidence and \nprobable consequences. The student should be provided the opportunity to \nprovide his/her perspective and respond to the allegation. Faculty members \nshould make their best effort to meet with the student in person, but if that is not \nfeasible, they can communicate in writing. The faculty member is expected to \nmaintain in confidence notes and communications between the student and the \nfaculty member except as they may be relevant in subsequent disciplinary \nproceedings or any subsequent legal actions. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4."}, {"source": "pdfs/SJSU-Academic-Integrity-Policy-F15-7.pdf", "chunk": "member is expected to \nmaintain in confidence notes and communications between the student and the \nfaculty member except as they may be relevant in subsequent disciplinary \nproceedings or any subsequent legal actions. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.3 Inform the student of the sanctions imposed in accordance with Section 4.0 if the \nfaculty member still believes that a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy has \noccurred. \n4.4 Report the alleged violation and the action taken to SCED on the Academic \nIntegrity Reporting Form2. The form identifies the faculty member, student \ninvolved, and type of violation (cheating or plagiarism) and includes a description \nof the incident and the academic sanctions imposed. SCED shall review the \nacademic sanctions imposed by the faculty member and determine whether they \nare justified in light of the provisions of the Student Conduct Code and \ncommensurate with university norms of severity. SCED shall further determine \nwhether it will impose administrative sanctions. The faculty member must submit \na copy of the supporting documentation to the Academic Integrity Reporting \nForm. After this initial report, no additional academic sanctions may be levied. \nAcademic sanctions may not be imposed without a report to SCED. Should the \nfaculty member neglect to file an appropriate report to SCED, any academic \nsanction imposed is invalid until the report is filed. All instances of ethical \nmisconduct should be known to the university and reported to SCED. They \nshould be reviewable and alterable by university oversight personnel, specifically \nthe Director of SCED. \n4.5 The instructor may impose the academic sanction and make the report called for \nin Section 4.4 without a conference when a student fails to attend a scheduled \nconference or discuss the alleged dishonesty and the faculty member makes a \ngood-faith, albeit unsuccessful, effort to contact the student in writing. In either \ncase, the student’s right to appeal is preserved. \n5.0 PROTECTION OF STUDENT RIGHTS \n5.1 Students are guaranteed due process, including the right to be informed of the \ncharges and nature of the evidence supporting the charges and to have a \nmeeting with the faculty member, SCED, or other decision makers. At any such \nmeeting, statements and evidence on behalf of the student may be submitted. \nThis policy is not intended to deny the right to appeal of any decision through \nappropriate university channels. \n5.2"}, {"source": "pdfs/SJSU-Academic-Integrity-Policy-F15-7.pdf", "chunk": "ED, or other decision makers.

This assessment shall be made in consideration of consistency \nacross the campus. \n5.3 If upon review by SCED, the student is found not responsible of the charges or if \ninsufficient evidence has been presented by the instructor to establish \nresponsibility, then the student shall be exonerated and the case dismissed. In \nthis event, the record of the alleged violation shall be expunged and academic \nsanctions against the student prohibited, barring an appeal by the faculty \nmember to the Board of Academic Freedom and Professional Responsibility \n(BAFPR). If SCED finds that sanctions should be modified, the instructor must \nmake those modifications, again barring an appeal by the faculty member to the \nBAFPR. Should the instructor refuse to lift or modify the sanctions recommended \nby SCED, the case shall be referred to the BAFPR. This section represents an \nexception to University Policy S99-9, Section IV.2. \n5.4 If the BAFPR upholds the findings of SCED to exonerate the student or to modify \nthe sanction, the instructor must lift the sanction imposed or modify it accordingly. \nIf the instructor refuses to do so, as per CSU Executive Order 1037, “it is the \nresponsibility of other qualified faculty to do so … [i.e.] one or more persons with \nacademic training comparable to the instructor of record who are presently on the \nfaculty at that campus.” Preferably, the department chair or school director, in \nconjunction with associate dean of the relevant college, shall be compelled to do \nso.

If the remedial action has not been taken within a reasonable time as \ndetermined by the BAFPR, a request to the President, Provost or appropriate \nvice president can be made by the BAFPR chair and/or student to expedite the \nresolution. \n5.5 All reasonable accommodations shall then be provided to the exonerated student \nif there is a fear of retaliation by the instructor. Accommodations might include \nthe ability to retake the course without charge from a different instructor or to \nsubstitute a different course (the latter if approved by the student’s advisor). If \nretaking the same course, credit for assignments completed in the previous \nattempt shall be afforded if comparable. Academic standing shall revert to the \nstanding that would have existed if the sanction had not been imposed. \n5.4 Student Appeal Process. An appeal must be filed in writing to the BAFPR \nbefore the last day of instruction of the semester following that in which the \nacademic sanction was imposed. The sanctions imposed and the SCED findings \nshall be taken up by the BAFPR within 30 days of the official filing of the appeal. \nEvidence submitted by both student and faculty member shall be considered and \nthe determination of responsibility shall be assessed. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6.0 THREATS \nThreats against any member of the faculty as a consequence of implementing this policy on \nacademic integrity shall be cause for disciplinary action under the Student Conduct Code (Title \n5 of the California Code of Regulations Section 41301), and may also result in civil and \ncriminal action. \n7.0 DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION \n7.1 The Academic Integrity Policy shall be published in the university catalog and on \nthe university website.
